# PWM Hybrid Synth Weekly Progress Report
#Report date: 2024-10-14

## Last Week (time in hours)
	Team Review
		-We began to generate potential project ideas and discuss the best way to set up a collaboration site. A definitive project has already been chosen
		 but generating additonal projects to "pick" is a bit more tricky then expected.
	Eric Sanman
		-Began to set up collaboration site and look into using KiCad (3)
	Chuong Vo
		-Began researching the best processor to use for the project and the differences between arduino microcontrollers and Atmel microcontrollers (2)
	Sierra Buckley
		- watching kicad videos and becoming familiar with it (2)
		- researching effects pedals for our design (2)
	Chris Crider
	
##Next Week
	Team Plan
		-Set up the collaboration site and finalize the proposal for three different projects and choose one.
		-Begin to brainstorm ideas and write the Product Design Specification
	Eric Sanman
		-Become more familiar with Kicad and Markdown (3)
		-Begin to create a preliminary Class-D amplifier design in KiCad (4)
	Chuong Vo
		-Finalize research of microcontrollers and report findings to team (2)
		-Choose a microcontrollers and begin research on potential libraries that could be used to for the synthesizer (2)
	Sierra Buckley
		- choose filters to design, model in LTspice (4)

## Monday
We focused on getting the collaboration site set up alongside Generating three project ideas and their components. 
Eric worked on getting more familiar with Markdown as well as KiCad. Eric is continuing to work on getting a preliminary amplifier design in KiCad. The amplifier is Class-D, and due to the HF nature of the circuit, it can't be prototyped on a breadboard. We plan on getting a PCB for this far in advance from the main class OSHPark order to test the circuit and layout to be implemented with the rest of the project later.
Chuong began researching 

## Tuesday
Eric figured out ground plane via stiching in KiCad and how to make multiple schematics that tie to one file in KiCad.

## Wednesday
