# SynthBuddy Weekly Progress Report
#Report date: 2024-10-17

## Last Week (time in hours)
	Team Review
		-We began to generate potential project ideas and discuss the best way to set up a collaboration site. A definitive project has already been chosen
		 but generating additonal projects to "pick" is a bit more tricky then expected.
	Eric Sanman
		-Began to set up collaboration site and look into using KiCad (3)
	Chuong Vo
		-Began researching the best processor to use for the project and the differences between arduino microcontrollers and Atmel microcontrollers (2)
	Sierra Buckley
		- watching kicad videos and becoming familiar with it (2)
		- researching effects pedals for our design (2)
	Chris Crider
	
##Next Week
	Team Plan
		-Set up the collaboration site and finalize the proposal for three different projects and choose one.
		-Begin to brainstorm ideas and write the Product Design Specification
	Eric Sanman
		-Become more familiar with Kicad and Markdown (3)
		-Begin to create a preliminary Class-D amplifier design in KiCad (4)
	Chuong Vo
		-Finalize research of microcontrollers and report findings to team (2)
		-Choose a microcontrollers and begin research on potential libraries that could be used to for the synthesizer (2)
	Sierra Buckley
		- choose filters to design, model in LTspice (4)
