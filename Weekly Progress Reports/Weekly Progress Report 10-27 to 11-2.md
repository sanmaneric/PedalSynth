		-Design work began on Kikad for the priliminary schematic of the synthesizer.
	Eric Sanman
		-
	Chuong Vo
		-Finished watching Kikad tutorial Video (2)
		-Began to model seperate schematics on Kikad based on the chosen effects that the synthesizer can perform (1.5)
		-Began to write Arduino code for the PWM function (1)

## Thursday ( :hamburger: Team Food Tour Day :cookie: )
 - #### :round_pushpin: Today's Food Tour Destination: Podnah's Pit BBQ
 - #### :star: Team Food Review: sleepy/10
Today, we met as a team and finalized our priliminary schematic. Each mode was cleaned up a bit and proper net labels were added.

As a team, we clarified what the goals of our project are in terms of how input is taken for the synthesizer (pushbutton keyboard, no intrument input).

Redo PDS by recreating level 0 and level 1 block diagrams, rewriting PDS-Sierra
