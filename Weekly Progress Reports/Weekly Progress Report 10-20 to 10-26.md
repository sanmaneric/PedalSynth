## Last Week (time in hours)
	Team Review
		-The collaboration site was officially launched and the three projects, pick one assignment was submitted
		-Work began on the Product Design Specification after a group meeting on 10-17-24 with good progress being made but it is still being written up.
		-
	Eric Sanman
		-
	Chuong Vo
		-Finalized microcontroller research and chose the best option to use for the Synth project (an ESP32 WRoom using Arduino) (2)
		-Began to looking into Arduino libaries for PWM and signal generation(1)
	Sierra Buckley
		- chose filters to design, modeled in LTspice (4)
		- git tutorial from Eric :) (1)
		- also sick (?)
	Chris Crider

## Sunday
Nothing to report, it's the weekend. :sleeping:

## Monday
We focused on getting our Project Design Specification hashed out and uploaded into GitHub. 
Eric did additional work on the Class D amp KiCad

## Tuesday
More in-depth work on KiCad: The layout for the amplifier is nearing completion.

## Wednesday
KiCad for the amplifier is starting to take final form. The componnets just need to be selected.

## Thursday ( :hamburger: Team Food Tour Day :cookie: )
 - #### :round_pushpin: Today's Food Tour Destination: No food tour this week! Sierra and Chris are sick this week.
 - #### :star: Team Food Review: n/a

## Friday
The board has been sent out to OSHpark! The components were also selected, however Eric realized he made a mistake with one of the capacitors so we'll have to stack two capactiros on one SMD pad- no big deal.

## Saturday
Nothing to report, it's the weekend. :sleeping:
