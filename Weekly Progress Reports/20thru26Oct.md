# :date: Weekly Progress Report for 20 through 26 October 2024

## Sunday
Nothing to report, it's the weekend. :sleeping:

## Monday
We focused on getting our Project Design Specification hashed out and uploaded into GitHub. Eric worked on getting more familiar with Markdown as well as KiCad. Eric is continuing to work on getting a preliminary amplifier design in KiCad. The amplifier is Class-D, and due to the HF nature of the circuit, it can't be prototyped on a breadboard. We plan on getting a PCB for this far in advance from the main class OSHPark order to test the circuit and layout to be implemented with the rest of the project later.
