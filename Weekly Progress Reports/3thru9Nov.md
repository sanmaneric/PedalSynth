Finalizing BOM - Sierra 

## Monday
Group meeting, discussing how to share tremolo and chorus rate and clock. Adding depth bybass to work as both on/off and depth potentiometer to chorus effect. -Sierra 
=======
Eric got one of the amp boards assembled and it worked on the first try! The bass response is a little lacking, which is something to fix.

## Monday
For the amplifiers, Eric changed the value of the aux input capacitor to a lower value, which extended the bass range as per the datasheet. More formal testing of the amplifier on a scope to come later this week.
